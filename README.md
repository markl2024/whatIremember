This repository is about what I remember on...
<br />

- <b>Question</b>
  I was asked "What is the difference between show ip bgp neighbor advertised routes , received routes and just routes?
- <b>Answer</b>
  Supoosed answer: Show ip bgp neighbor advertised routes: are advertised routes, received routes are received routes and just routes: combination of advertised and received routes.

- <b>Question</b> What are the requirements of VPN tunnel
- <b>Answer</b> I answered PSK, Encryption, Encryption Domain.. And they are asking for more until I reached on mentioning Phase1 and Phase2. And got confused with Ikev1 and Ikev2. I hardly stick to my answer that Ikev1 and Ikev2 are different tunnels and bro got confused further. What I really want to answer is Ikev1 and Ikev2 are really different tunnel.
